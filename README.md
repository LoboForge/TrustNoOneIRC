# 🔐 TNO IRC Client

Welcome to the **TNO IRC Client** — a fully custom-built, hacker-themed, secure-by-default IRC client built on **Blazor** and **Electron.NET**.  
This project brings a modern UI, hardened opsec, and the classic power of IRC to the desktop — **no browser required**.

---

## ✨ Features

- 🧠 **Blazor + Electron.NET**: Runs as a standalone desktop app — cross-platform and offline-capable.
- 🔒 **Tor Support**: Automatically connects over Tor using built-in SOCKS5 proxy support.
- 🪪 **Client Certificate Auth (SASL EXTERNAL)**: Authenticate using pinned client certificates.
- 🧭 **NickServ & WHOIS Tools**: Inspect identities, verify fingerprints, and automate registration.
- ⚙️ **Raw IRC Mode**: View and inject raw protocol messages like a pro.
- 🧰 **Plugin-Ready Command Dispatcher**: Extend with your own logic using dependency-free bots.
- 🪟 **Multi-Window Tabbed UI**: Each channel, PM, or server console lives in its own tab.
- 🧙‍♂️ **Stylized Hacker Theme**: Matrix-green, smoked glass, and bold lines.  
- 💻 **Cross-Platform**: Fully packaged builds for **Windows** and **Linux (AppImage + Snap)**.

```

## 🔐 Certificate Authentication (SASL EXTERNAL)

```bash
openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout irc.key -out irc.crt -days 365 -nodes -subj "/CN=YourNick"
openssl pkcs12 -export -out irc.pfx -inkey irc.key -in irc.crt
```

Then connect normally, and register your fingerprint with:

```
/msg NickServ CERT ADD <your sha512 fingerprint>
```

---

## 🧠 Tips

- Use `/whois YourNick` to verify that your cert was accepted.
- All bots implement `IBot` and can respond to events or PMs — check the `BotScripts` folder for samples.
